1. When #define DATA_TYPE int:
  (1). gcc: both O3 and O0 the sor3.c is better than sor.c.
  (2). clang: for O0, sor3.c is better than sor.c but for O3 sor3.c is slower than sor.c.
  The O3 sor3.c is slower than sor.c since it call memset() in sor.c while sor3.c didn't.
2. When #define DATA_TYPE double:
  (1). clang and gcc: both O3 and O0 the sor3.c is better than sor.c.
  

3. When for loop include X, Y and Z 3 statements, then the time in sor3.O3 is worse
than sor.O3. Because the instruction cache miss higher in sor3.O3. Verify by oprofile:
./ocount --events=l1d_pend_miss:pending,icache:misses ./sor.O3
